# Learning postgresSQL
Tinkering with postgresSQL.


PostgresSQL is an open-source relational database maangement system. 

### Starting postgresSQL
To start/stop/control the server I'll be using **pg_ctl**. 
```
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
```
I'm using a mac, so the directory **/usr/local/var/postgres** might vary from your machine.


### Using the shell
psql is the PostgreSQL interactive terminal. To run the interactive shell, type
```
psql postgres 
```
It will promt a new cli. The **postgres** is a default database that came with the installation.

To check if everything is alright, we can check the version type
```
select version();
```

and the output should be similar to 

```sql
PostgreSQL 12.3 on x86_64-apple-darwin19.5.0, compiled by Apple clang version 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.62), 64-bit
(1 row)
```

### Creating a database

```
create DATABASE $dbName;

# example 
create DATABASE test_db;
```

the output should be
```
CREATE DATABASE
```

### Listing all databases
To list all database in the interactive shell, type ```\l```, it is not a SQL command so no need to use semi colons.

![Listing all databases](https://i.ibb.co/wrwdkDP/image.png)

### Switching databases
To swithc to database, type ```\c $dbname``` to start using the database. For example
```\c test_db```.
The output should be similar to 
```
You are now connected to database "test_db" as user "prophecy".
```
Again, this is not a SQL command, so no need to add semi-colons.

So now we are in our practice database, let's create some tables. We'll start with ```colours``` table.

### Deleting a database
```sql
DROP DATABASE $database_name;
```

### Connecting to database
The command to connect to a database is 
```bash
psql -h $host_ip_or_domain -p $port -U $username -W $password $dbname
```
So in my case, (password is ommited as my default password blank/I don't have a default password.)
```bash
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U username dbname
```

### Creating a table
To create a table, our syntax is 
```sql
CREATE TABLE $tableName (
	$column_1 $data_type $optional_meta_information, 
	$column_2 $data_type $optional_meta_infromation,
	$column_N $data_type $optional_meta_information,
	$table_constraints
);
```
Lets start simple, 
So our command will be 
```sql
CREATE TABLE colours (
	id int PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, 
	name varchar(20) NOT NULL, 
	hex varchar(7)
);
```
To know if it worked, we can check tables,  by typeing ```\dt``` while we are in the database.
![List of all tables](https://i.ibb.co/L5Gwg2t/image.png)

### Inserting data
As of now, we have our table and we can store some data in it. To store data, we use a **insert** query. The insert query is structured as follows 
```sql
INSERT INTO $table_name ($column_1, $column_2, ... $column_N) VALUES ($value_of_column_1, $value_of_column_2, ... $value_of_column_N);
```
This will insert a single row. If we want to insert multiple rows at once, we can append to the values.

```sql 
INSERT INTO $table_name ($column_1, $column_2, ... $column_N) VALUES ($row_1_column_1, $row_1_column_2, ... $row_1_column_N),($row_2_column_1, $row_2_column_2, ... $row_2_column_N),($row_N_column_1, $row_N_column_2, ... $row_N_column_N);
```
#### Example 
So for creating a single row 

```sql
INSERT INTO colours (id, name) VALUES (1, 'red');
```
For inserting multiple rows 
```sql
INSERT INTO colours (id, name, hex) VALUES (2, 'green',''), (3, 'blue','3399ff');
```

The output should be ```INSERT 0 2```  or similar.

To see if everything worked correctly, we can list all our records from our table by using the ```SELECT``` command.
```sql
SELECT * FROM $table_name;
```
So our command will be,
```sql
SELECT ALL FROM colours;
```
The result should be a list data.
![Selecting all records from our colours table.](https://i.ibb.co/VJgLCGB/image.png)
Now, with the ``*`` , we have selected all the columns. To select a specific column, we can specificy them in place of asterisk.
```sql
SELECT column_a, column_b FROM $table_name;
``` 
So our example will be
```sql
SELECT name, hex from colours;
```
![Returning specific columns](https://i.ibb.co/qMTRsHQ/image.png)


### Updating a record
syntax 
```sql
UPDATE $table_name SET $column_name = $value, $another_column = $another value, ... $nth_column_name = $some_value WHERE $condition;
```
example
```sql
UPDATE users SET name = 'Aryan Ahmed Anik' WHERE email='thearyanahmed@gmail.com' OR email='theprophecy@gmail.com';
```
**Warning** If you don't provide a where clause or a always true where clause, the operation will be performed against all the data on the table.

### Deleting a record
syntax
```sql
DELETE FROM $table_name WHERE $condition;
```
example
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id > 10;
```

**Warning** If you don't provide a where clause or a always true where clause, the operation will be performed against all the data on the table.
```sql 
DELETE FROM users WHERE 1;
# or 
DELETE FROM users; 
```
All the records will be deleted.


### Comparison operators
|syntax| what it means  | example |
|--|--|--|
| = | equals to | id = 2 |
| > | greater than | id > 2 |
| < | less than | id < 10 |
| >= | greater than or equals to | id >= 10 |
| <= | less than or equals to | id <= 100 |
| <> | not equals to | id <> 102 |
| \|\| | contact strings | 'hello ' \|\| 'world' |
| !!= | not in | 3 !! = i |
| ~~ | like | 'scrappy,marc,hermit' ~~ '%scrappy%' |
| !~~ | not like | 'bruce' !~~ '%al%' |
| ~ | match (regex), case sensitive | 'thomas' ~ '\*.thomas\*.' |
| ~* | match (regex), case insensitive | 'thomas' ~\* '\*.thomas\*.' |
| !~ | Does not match (regex), case sensitive | 'thomas' !~ '\*.Thomas\*.'|
| !~*| Does not match (regex), case insensitive | 'thomas' !~ '\*.vadim\*.' |

### Arithmetic Operators
|syntax| what it means  | example |
|--|--|--|
| + | addition | SELECT 2 + 5 |
| - | subtraction | SELECT 5 -2 |
| / | division | 10 / 2 |
| * | multiplication | 5 * 3 |
| % | modulo | 12 % 5 |
| % | truncate | % 4.5 |
| ! | factorial | 3! |
| !! | factorial (left operation) | !! 5 |
| : | natural Exponentiation | : 3.0 |
| ; | natural Logarithm | (; 5.0) |
| @ | absolute value | @ -5.0 |
| \|/ | square root | \|/ 25.0 |
| \|\|/ | cubic root | \|\|/ 27.0 |


### Sorting or Ordering data
To order our data by a column in a ascending order,
```sql
SELECT * FROM $table_name ORDER BY $column_name $ASC_OR_DESC;
```
so to order our data by name, 
```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name ASC;
```
Our result looks like this,
![user's list](https://i.ibb.co/sw5ZScQ/image.png)
As you see the id doesn't add up to the next row's id.  If we try it in descending order, 
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/JrPsxRh/image.png)

#### Combining multiple columns in sorting

```sql
SELECT * FROM $table_name ORDER BY $column_1, $column_2, ... $column_N $ASC_OR_DESC;
```
for example 
```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id, name ASC;
```
**Note:** If you do not specify the order (ascending or descending), the default will be Ascending.
### Distinct or selecting the unique
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT $column_name from $table_name;
```
### WHERE & AND Conditionals 
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE $column = $value;
```
For adding more than 1 condition, we use **AND**.
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE $column = $value AND $another_column = $some_value AND ... $some_other_column_n = $some_value;
```
for example 
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id > 30 and gender = 'Male' ORDER BY name ASC;
```
And we have our results.
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/NjM1VHj/image.png)

### OR 
syntax 
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE $column = $value OR $column = $value; # columns can be same or different.
```
example.
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE country = 'Bangladesh' OR country = 'Singapore' OR country = 'France';
```

### IN 
If you are quering in a single column, you can shorten the code by using in keyword.
syntax 
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE country IN ('Bangladesh', 'Singapore','France'); 
```
**Note :** You can obviously use multiple *OR*, even with *IN* clause.

### Between
The between keyword is used to select data from a range.
syntax 
```sql
SELECT * FROM $table_name WHERE $column_name BETWEEN $starting_point AND $ending_point;
```
example
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 10;
```

### LIKE
Like is used to match patterns.
syntax
```sql
SELECT * FROM $table_name WHERE $column_name LIKE $pattern;
```
So, lets query out all the users who has 'United' in their country name.
query
```sql
SELECT name, country FROM users WHERE country LIKE '%United%' order by name;
```
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/GWJgmrP/image.png)

#### patterns 

|like| description  |
|--|--|--|
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%' | Finds any values that start with "a"|
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'| Finds any values that end with "a"|
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%' | Finds any values that have "or" in any position|
|WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%' |Finds any values that have "r" in the second position|
|WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%'|Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length|
|WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%'|Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length|
|WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'|Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"|

**Note to self** underscores are used to match single characters.
### ILIKE
ILIKE is used to search with case insensitivity.

### Limit
syntax 
```sql
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT $limit;
```
example
```sql
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10;
```

![limiting](https://i.ibb.co/m6m8fp8/image.png)

**Note to self** Limit is not a SQL standard. We can achieve the same result by using **FETCH**.
syntax 
```sql
... FETCH FIRST N ROWS; # n is positive integer, can be ommited if n = 1.
```

### Offset
We often need to select records after a specific number of results. We might need to select 10 items from 30th. Meaning 30th to 40th elements of the results.Pagination is a good example of it.
If such scenarios, *OFFSET* comes into play. 
syntax 
```sql
SELECT * FROM $table_name OFFSET $n; # n = positive integer.
```
example
```sql
SELECT * FROM users OFFSET 5, LIMIT 10 ORDER BY id;
```

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/Bj30Fzx/image.png)


### Group by
syntax 
```sql
... GROUP BY $column_name;
```

example 
```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY country;
```
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/YXCpp3V/image.png)

### Having
Having works with group by, adds up an extra layer of filter.
example
```sql
SELECT country, count(*) FROM users GROUP BY country HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```
This will return all the country's where the count of people are greater than 5.
**Note** having must come before *order by*.

### MAX 
syntax 
```sql
SELECT MAX($column_name) FROM $table_name;
```
example
```sql
SELECT MAX(price) FROM cars;
```
It will return a single row, with the max priced value.

### MIN 
syntax 
```sql
SELECT MIN($column_name) FROM $table_name;
```
example
```sql
SELECT MIN(price) FROM cars;
```
It will return a single row, with the minimum priced value.

### AVG (average) 
syntax 
```sql
SELECT AVG($column_name) FROM $table_name;
```
example
```sql
SELECT AVG(price) FROM cars;
```
It will return a single row, with the average priced value.

### SUM 
syntax 
```sql
SELECT SUM($column_name) FROM $table_name;
```
example
```sql
SELECT SUM(price) FROM cars;
```
It will return a single row, with the sum of the price column.

### Alias
You can use the `as` keyword followed by a name or alias you want to use.
syntax
```sql
SELECT $column_name AS $alias FROM $table_name;
```
example
```sql
SELECT name as car_name FROM cars;
```
It will output the name column as car_name, the values will remain the same.

### Coalesce 
Coalesce function gives us the benefit to add a default value if the first value does not exists.
syntax
```sql
SELECT COALESCE($first_value, $default_value);
```
you can have multiple values to check, and if it does not exist, it will fall back to the next default value.
For example,
```sql
SELECT COALESCE($first_value, $second_value_if_first_value_is_null, $third_value_if_second_value_is_null,...,$nth_value_if_(n-1)th_value_is_null);
```
### Date
Get the current time 
```sql
SELECT NOW();
```
Get current time
```sql
SELECT NOW()::TIME;
```
Get current date
```sql
SELECT NOW()::DATE;
```

#### calcuating dates
Subtracting date
```sql
SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '10 YEARS'; # should return the date from 10 years ago.
```
Adding days
```sql
SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL '10 MONTHS'; # should return the date after 10 months.
```
#### extracting data
Extracting can be done by the EXTRACT function.
```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM NOW());
```

### Primary keys (PK)
Primary keys are unique identifiers accross all the data of any table. Primary key is not a must have column. This does not hold any value outside of the database. It is unique everytime its generated. Even if we delete a key, the next one will not be the same.
#### Adding primary key
```sql
ALTER TABLE $table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY ($key1,$key2,...$keyN);
```
example
```sql
ALTER TABLE cars ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
```
So, why did our syntax say **KEY (\$key1,\$key2,.. \$keyN);**.  Well because, we often need a unique key based on two or multiple columns. Those are called **composite keys**.

#### Dropping primary key by altering table
syntax
```sql
ALTER TABLE $table_name DROP CONSTRAINT $primary_key_constraint;
```
so if we want to drop cars table's primary key constraint,
```sql
ALTER TABLE cars DROP CONSTRAINT cars_pkey;
```
If you are using numeric column as primary key, it will auto increment by 1 by default.

### Unique
we have unique constraint to make a record unique accross the whole table. For example, we can add unique constraint to the email to make sure there are no duplicate emails.
syntax
```sql
ALTER TABLE $table_name ADD CONSTRAINT $identifier UNIQUE ($column_name);
```
example 
```sql
ALTER TABLE cars ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email_address UNIQUE (email);
```
### Check constraint
syntax
```sql
ALTER TABLE $table_name ADD CONSTRAINT $constrant_name CHECK ($logic);
```
example
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT gender_constraint CHECK (gender = 'Male');
```





### Data types
PostgresSQL supports a various number of data types. You can find them [here in the PostgresSQL supported data types document.](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/datatype.html)

### Relations

#### inner joins

Inner join takes the values that are common/present to both table.
![inner join diagram.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5732253c8a65e244fd589e4c/1464122775537-YVL7LO1L7DU54X1MC2CI/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMjn7pTzw5xRQ4HUMBCurC5Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWMv8jMPmozsPbkt2JQVr8L3VwxMIOEK7mu3DMnwqv-Nsp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIvqemgO4J3VrkuBnQHKRCXIkZ0MkTG3f7luW22zTUABU/image-asset.png)

syntax 
```sql
SELECT $columns FROM $first_table JOIN $second_table ON $first_table.joining_column = $second_table.reference_column;
```
Suppose we have a 1 to 1 relationship, where each user can have a car. A column `car_id` in users table points to the `id` column in the cars table.  So our query would be,
```sql
SELECT * FROM users JOIN cars ON users.car_id = cars.id;
```
We have 4 users, 1 user doesn't have a car assocaited with them.
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/DQXrzrS/image.png)
### Left join
Left join selects all the records from the left table even if they don't have a related record in the right table. 
![enter image description here](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5732253c8a65e244fd589e4c/1464122797709-C2CDMVSK7P4V0FNNX60B/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMjn7pTzw5xRQ4HUMBCurC5Zw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEV3Z0iVQKU6nVSfbxuXl2c1HrCktJw7NiLqI-m1RSK4p2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIO5TUUNB3eG_Kh3ocGD53-KZS67ndDu8zKC7HnauYqqk/image-asset.png)

syntax 
```sql
SELECT $columns FROM $first_table LEFT JOIN $second_table ON $first_table.joining_column = $second_table.reference_column;
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM users LEFT JOIN cars ON users.car_id = cars.id;
```
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/Ykdn93Y/image.png)

### Selecting specific columns
We can prepend the table name with a dot to be more speicifc query. Instead of `SELECT name from users` we can write `SELECT users.name FROM users`, being more specific.
**Why is this necessary?** Often we have same named columns in multiple tables, for example, a user can have name, a company table can have name, a cars table can have name. You get the idea. And also, when **JOINING** , we can be more specific instead of selecting all columns.  
So, a inner join would be

```sql
SELECT users.name, cars.name FROM users JOIN cars ON users.car_id = cars.id; # we are only selecting user's name and the name of the car they own.
```
**Note to self** We don't need to memorize every bit but build up the queries from a simple statement and adding up more and more.
